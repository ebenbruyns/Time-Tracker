This code is released as is, it was a proof of concept that turned out to be useful and thus released on the App Store.

Since it's no longer economical to maintain the code we've decided to release is as open source. Do with it what ever 
you want, but please don't criticise the code, we are aware that it might not be best practice by current standards.
